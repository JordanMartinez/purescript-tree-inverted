# PureScript-Tree-Inverted

A `Tree` using an inverted table approach (i.e. a table where the rows are columns (i.e. array index) and the columns are rows).

I learned of this approach to modeling trees from Aaron Hsu (@arcfide). It comes from the array-oriented programming paradigm.

This library is purely experimental right now.
